# Notes Organization System Rules

## Automatic Inbox Processing

When files are present in `00-Inbox/`, automatically process them without requiring explicit user request.

### Processing Workflow

1. **PDF/DOCX Conversion:**
   - PDF files → `node scripts/convert_pdf.js <file> --output-dir 00-Inbox/`
   - DOCX files → `node scripts/convert_docx.js <file> --output-dir 00-Inbox/`
   - PDF/DOCX files in attachment folders → Convert using same scripts with output-dir set to attachment folder
   - Delete original files after successful conversion
   - **IMPORTANT**: All PDF and DOCX files in attachment folders must be converted to Markdown. Only Markdown files should remain in attachment folders after processing.

2. **Markdown Formatting:**
   - Normalize spacing (consistent line breaks between sections)
   - Ensure proper heading hierarchy
   - Clean up excessive whitespace
   - Fix common markdown formatting issues
   - Improve list formatting consistency
   - Add appropriate spacing around code blocks, tables, etc.

3. **Content Detection:**
   - Analyze files to determine appropriate destination based on keywords and content
   - Check for keywords: "meeting", "email", "document", "project", "idea", "business", "personal", "person", "contact", "call", "discussion", "session", "sync", "message", "correspondence", "contract", "agreement", "letter", "statement", "task", "milestone", "concept", "brainstorm", "company", "corporate", "strategy", "career", "resume", "cv", "relationship"

4. **File Routing:**
   - Meeting notes (keywords: "meeting", "call", "discussion", "session", "sync") → `02-Meetings/[YYYY]/[MM]/` with naming: `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[title].md`
   - Email content (keywords: "email", "message", "correspondence") → `03-Emails/[YYYY]/[MM]/` with naming: `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[title].md`
   - Documents (keywords: "document", "contract", "agreement", "letter", "statement") → `04-Documents/[YYYY]/[MM]/` with naming: `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[title].md`
   - Project documentation (keywords: "project", "task", "milestone") → `06-Projects/` (or date-based `06-Projects/[YYYY]/[MM]/` if applicable)
   - Ideas and concepts (keywords: "idea", "concept", "brainstorm") → `07-Ideas/`
   - Business reference materials (keywords: "business", "company", "corporate", "strategy") → `08-Business/[YYYY]/[MM]/` with naming: `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[title].md` (NOT meeting notes)
   - Personal reference materials (keywords: "personal", "career", "resume", "cv") → `09-Personal/[YYYY]/[MM]/` with naming: `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[title].md` (NOT meeting notes)
   - People-related notes (keywords: "person", "contact", "relationship") → `05-People/` (reference materials only, NOT meeting notes)
   - If destination is unclear: Prompt the user to clarify where the file should be placed

5. **Date Extraction:**
   - Extract dates from filenames, content, file metadata, or email headers
   - Format dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601)

6. **File Organization:**
   - Format dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` for meeting notes, emails, documents, business docs, and personal docs
   - Organize into year/month folders: `[YYYY]/[MM]/` for all date-based destinations
   - Rename files to follow naming conventions: `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[title].md` before moving
   - For emails with attachments, move attachments (in folders) with the email to maintain relationship

7. **Cleanup:**
   - Delete original files from inbox after successful processing
   - Only `README.md` should remain in the inbox folder

## Naming Conventions

### Meeting Notes
- Format: `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[title].md`
- Location: `02-Meetings/[YYYY]/[MM]/`
- Examples: `2025-11-10-business-partner-meeting.md`, `2025-09-26-client-discussion.md`

### Emails
- Format: `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[title].md`
- Location: `03-Emails/[YYYY]/[MM]/`

### Documents
- Format: `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[title].md`
- Location: `04-Documents/[YYYY]/[MM]/`

### Business Documents
- Format: `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[title].md`
- Location: `08-Business/[YYYY]/[MM]/`
- **NOT meeting notes** - meeting notes go to `02-Meetings/`

### Personal Documents
- Format: `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[title].md`
- Location: `09-Personal/[YYYY]/[MM]/`
- **NOT meeting notes** - meeting notes go to `02-Meetings/`

### General Rules
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601)
- Date comes first for chronological sorting
- Title should be lowercase with hyphens separating words
- Title should be descriptive but concise
- No spaces in filenames (use hyphens instead)

## Critical Organization Rules

- **ALL meeting notes** (dated notes from meetings, discussions, sessions) → `02-Meetings/[YYYY]/[MM]/`
- Business-related **meeting notes** → `02-Meetings/[YYYY]/[MM]/` (NOT `08-Business/`)
- Business-related **information/docs** → `08-Business/[YYYY]/[MM]/` (reference materials only)
- People-related **meeting notes** → `02-Meetings/[YYYY]/[MM]/` (NOT `05-People/`)
- People-related **reference notes** → `05-People/` (reference materials only)
- Personal **meeting notes** → `02-Meetings/[YYYY]/[MM]/`
- Personal **reference docs** → `09-Personal/[YYYY]/[MM]/` (templates, plans, etc. without dates)

## Date-Based Structure

All sub-folders use `[YYYY]/[MM]/` structure when sorting files:
- `02-Meetings/[YYYY]/[MM]/`
- `03-Emails/[YYYY]/[MM]/`
- `04-Documents/[YYYY]/[MM]/`
- `08-Business/[YYYY]/[MM]/`
- `09-Personal/[YYYY]/[MM]/`

## Code Style Rules

- Always use strict conditions (use === checks where possible)
- Prefer early returns over deep nesting
- Follow all naming conventions strictly
- Extract dates from filenames, content, or metadata
- Convert PDF/DOCX files to Markdown before processing
- Route files based on content analysis and keywords
- Organize date-based files into `[YYYY]/[MM]/` folder structure

## Meeting Notes Rules

- **NEVER update meeting notes unless specifically requested by the user**
- Meeting notes in `02-Meetings/` are historical records and should remain unchanged
- Do not add updates, corrections, or additional information to meeting notes unless explicitly asked
- If information needs to be updated, update `01-General/todos.md` or other appropriate documentation files instead
