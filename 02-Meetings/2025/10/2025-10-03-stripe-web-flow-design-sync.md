## AI Note-Taking Discussion

- **Fathom vs Zoom recording comparison**
  - Fathom: instant availability, email delivery with annotated sections
  - Zoom: 30-minute wait time, often forgotten/unused

- **Benefits of manual note-taking**
  - Forces information synthesis during meetings
  - Helps maintain attention and focus
  - Useful for capturing action items that might slip by

## Stripe Checkout Integration Overview

- Found Stripe's packaged checkout flow documentation: [https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)
  - Pre-built solution reduces custom development needs
  - Design decisions now focus on customization rather than building from scratch
