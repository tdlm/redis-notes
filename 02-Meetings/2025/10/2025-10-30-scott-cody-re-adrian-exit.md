# Scott and Cody: Re: Adrian Exit

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Attendees:** Scott, Cody (cody.henshaw@redis.com)

## Team Restructuring & Changes

- Adrian was let go due to organizational restructuring, not performance issues
- Complete restructuring happening across multiple teams (design, campaigns, demand gen)
  - Aligning with cloud growth function priorities
  - Financial preparation for potential IPO
- Short-term plan:
  - No new full-time developer headcount approved
  - Increase bandwidth through Woolly Mammoth or closer contractors
  - Hire conversion rate optimization specialist/web manager for day-to-day operations

## Personal Positioning & Performance

- What can I do to avoid similar fate?
  - Continue being curious, kind, and engaged
  - Remain helpful - people fight harder for those they like working with
  - Consistently rated in top-right on nine-box quarterly evaluations
- Nominated for marketing awards, well-regarded by team
- Need to figure out perfect onboarding process for new hire
- How can we make the new guy's day really easy?

## Technical Tools & Development

- Claude AI workflow recommendation:
  - Using $200/month version for complex projects
  - Creating summary files to manage context window limits
  - Building messaging frameworks from slides, customer calls, brand guides
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) exploration:
  - Context7 for documentation integration
  - Figma MCP allows live design modifications through AI
  - Sanity released their MCP for data structure integration
  - Instruction guide on Anthropic for building custom MCP servers
- Codex vs Claude comparison:
  - Codex slower but more accurate
  - Claude faster but requires more iteration

## Next Steps

- Scott to send OKRs focusing on migration completion, testing setup, and A/B tests
- Schedule longer follow-up to level-set priorities and assess current projects
- Streamline workflow between Kelsey and web producers to avoid miscommunication
