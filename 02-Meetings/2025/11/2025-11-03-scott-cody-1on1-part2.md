# Scott and Cody 1-on-1 (Part 2)

**Date:** November 3, 2025  
**Attendees:** Scott, Cody

## Workflow and Task Management

- Web producer work needs stricter oversight
  - All work must be pre-approved going forward
  - Kelsey to direct assignments based on capacity
  - Producers limited to content entry using existing components
  - Custom CSS/development work deferred to backlog
- Scott creating own Asana tasks for better visibility
  - Existing automated processes disconnect from stakeholder communications
  - Will attach new tasks to existing projects when logical
  - Individual task details less important than big picture project status
- Need higher-level project view showing:
  - Current backlog status
  - End dates and blockers
  - Major milestone splits (like DevHub home page decoupling)

## Ad Hoc Request Management

- Scott picking up Scott Adrian's previous responsibilities
  - Recent tags from Mac, Adam Haskiu, Ophir over weekend
  - Requests taking 20-30+ minutes should be escalated
  - Manager will serve as "bad guy" for prioritization pushback
- Framework for handling interruptions:
  - Quick fixes (<30 min) - handle directly
  - Longer requests - escalate for prioritization
  - Surface ad hoc work that impacts project timelines
- Potential for local contractor ($100/hour) for simple fixes
- Hiring planned for CRO role to manage tasks

## Development Tools Discussion

- Claude AI workflow explored
  - Manager pays $200/month personal subscription
  - Uses nested folder structure with context inheritance
  - Parent folders contain Redis/team info, children inherit context
  - Automatic summarization when context window exceeded
- Scott to try Codex through Copilot as alternative
- Future OS-level AI integration anticipated over current fragmented tools
