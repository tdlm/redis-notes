## Three Strategic Priorities for FY27

- **AI dominance across multiple use cases**
  - Focus on 5 key areas: web-scale search, RAG applications, semantic caching, agent memory, feature stores
  - 180,000 downloads of LangGraph integration in one month
  - Recent wins: Character AI, IBM, Vizio (Walmart's smart TV platform)

- **Best Redis Cloud service globally**
  - Redis Flex now GA on Redis Cloud Pro - up to 75% lower cost per gig
  - RDI (Redis Data Integration) entering public preview
  - Zero downtime features with smart client handoffs
  - BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) for enterprise security and cost optimization

- **One story, one voice - narrowing company focus**
  - Moving from expansion phase to focused execution
  - Shedding non-working initiatives, doubling down on proven areas
  - Jonathan Fritz (Chief Product Officer) and Manvinder leading crisp product story

## IPO Timeline and Market Readiness

- Current growth rate (low 20s) insufficient for public markets
- Target: sustained high 20s to low 30s growth rate required
- Key metrics needed for IPO readiness:
  - Net dollar retention >120%
  - Gross retention in high 80s/low 90s
  - Clear path to profitability within 18 months post-IPO
- Strong investor interest in Redis's AI positioning
- Q4 performance critical - didn't hit plans, need to execute better
- IPO timing uncertain pending fiscal year planning results

## Financial Performance and Targets

- Current ARR approaching $300M milestone
- Cloud deal sizes increasing: $50K average last year → $122K this quarter
- Focus shifting to customer renewals and retention
- Gross renewal rates behind industry standards - key improvement area
- Growth is company-wide responsibility, not just sales team
- Path to $1B revenue company clearly visible

## AWS re:Invent Strategy and Execution

- Largest Redis presence ever at re:Invent
- 55+ customer/prospect meetings booked in private meeting space
- Custom booth in Developer Center with bright red branding
- Airport advertising in Las Vegas
- 11 theater sessions, 10 demos, multiple breakouts
- Hallucination Hub partnership showcasing AI capabilities
- IFood potentially presenting alongside Redis

## AI Product Leadership Across Five Use Cases

- **Web-scale search:** Character AI replacement win, IBM partnership
- **RAG applications:** Raymond James expansion, Amgen deployment
- **Semantic caching:** Vizio deal closed days after LangCache launch
- **Agent memory:** TriSantis and Paychecks adopting LangGraph integration
- **Feature stores:** Enhanced with Feature Form acquisition and RDI integration

## Key Product Innovations and Launches

- Redis 8.4 launching - fastest, most stable open source version
- Redis Flex GA with customizable RAM/SSD ratios (10-90% increments)
- RDI public preview enabling real-time data streaming from Postgres/MongoDB
- Feature Form acquisition creating complete feature store solution
