## Personal Updates

- Scott's daughter turned 18 today
  - Celebrated at Universal Studios with friends

  - Celebrating tonight at home
- Halloween went well despite running out of full-size candy
  - More trick-or-treaters than expected

## Current Work Progress

- Managing various one-off requests effectively
  - Kevin Wiley reaching out with tasks
  - Working on bug fixes from Adrian's queue
  - Created PR for missing parameter issue (requested by Ophir, VP of Product Management)
- WordPress migration nearly complete
  - Identified components without Sanity equivalents: accordion, tab switcher, trust bar, columns
  - Converting HTML details/summary blocks to bulleted lists for Q&A sections
  - Need to download/reupload existing images rather than reference them
  - Planning to switch to staging Sanity dataset to avoid production interference
- Account transfer blocked waiting for PIN to deleted email
  - Support requires PIN sent to Adrian's old email
  - May need Cody's help to recreate account temporarily

## Pending Items & Blockers

- Stripe payment integration waiting for access
  - Sally coordinating with Flock J developers
  - Target completion end of year
  - Simple checkout setup once access granted
- Custom 404 page request from Kevin Wiley
  - Based on old Asana task from previous Scott

  - Need to clarify with Kevin that this is design update only
- Pricing component on hold pending tutorial completion
- Need Kelsey's input on remaining WordPress pages for potential 404 redirect
