### Redis for AI: Positioning & Messaging Framework

- Final positioning locked in: **Real-time context engine**
  - Evolved from "working memory layer" and "context layer" iterations
  - Engine chosen over layer for more active, broader market positioning
  - Encompasses all current and future Redis AI products
- Core value proposition: Help developers build fast and accurate AI apps that scale
  - Search, gather, and serve AI data in one unified place
  - Provides memory, caching, and coordination for AI agents
  - Coordination replaced "orchestration" to be broader term

### Four Messaging Pillars with Proof Points

- **Fast**: Faster retrieval and lower latency
  - Redis LangCache: 5x lower latency, reduced LLM calls
  - Fastest benchmarked vector database
  - Sub-millisecond latency (removed "guaranteed" qualifier after team feedback)
  - High throughput AI apps
- **Accurate**: Right data at right place, right time
  - Redis Query Engine: vector search, full text search, hybrid search
  - Custom Redis embeddings
  - RedisVL for context gathering and serving
- **Scalable**: Reliable performance at any scale
  - Benchmarked at billion vectors
  - Active-active, five nines uptime
  - Horizontal scaling with automatic sharding
  - Built for development through production
- **Integrated**: One unified platform across AI stack
  - Unified search across RAG, memory, structured/unstructured data
  - Partnerships with existing AI tools (Bedrock, LangChain, LlamaIndex)
  - Agent memory integrations with Mem0, Langgraph

### Implementation & Next Steps

- Apply to all new AI content creation
  - Reference "real-time context engine" positioning consistently
  - Incorporate four benefit pillars in audience briefs
- Company-wide messaging alignment effort
  - Marketing team to identify outdated messaging for updates
  - Strategic document serves as guide, not copy-paste content
  - Examples already live on LangCache and Redis for AI web pages
