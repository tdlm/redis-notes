# Myra El-Bayoumi

Fri, 12 Dec 25

### Cody's Departure & Team Transition

- Cody got let go unexpectedly - no advance notice to team or Myra
- Massive confusion across team about lack of communication/planning
- Email announcement contained typo ("longer with company" vs "no longer")
- Critical infrastructure concerns:
  - Proxy connecting old WordPress to new [Redis.io](http://Redis.io) lives in Cody's personal repo
  - Could cause website chaos if disconnected
- General team sentiment: "unforced error" and poor decision-making from leadership

### New Reporting Structure

- Scott now reports to Myra (interim arrangement, max 1 year expected)
- Web function staying under Growth vs moving to Ian's team
- New web manager role being created - Scott will be key stakeholder in hiring process
  - Scott has referral candidate ready
  - Interview panel: Scott, Ian, Mac, Myra
- Team culture maintained: minimal meetings, high autonomy, transparency focus
- Scott added to Monday 9am team meetings + holiday event Wednesday

### Business Continuity & Next Steps

- Scott continues current work - no changes to day-to-day responsibilities
- Migration work continues unless Cody shuts it down
- Weekly 1:1s with Myra to be scheduled
- OKRs discussion needed for upcoming goals
- Scott's vacation plans accommodated - company adjusts to changes they made
