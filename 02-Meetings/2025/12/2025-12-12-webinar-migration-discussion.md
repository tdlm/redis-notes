# Webinar Migration Planning Discussion

## Context

Discussion in #build-web about handling webinars that currently live in the Events section and planning migration to the new "Videos and Webinars" section.

## Discussion

**Scott Weaver** (3:49 PM):

> @here Does anyone know the plan for handling webinars that currently live in the Events section; specifically whether they should be deleted from Events and recreated in the new "Videos and Webinars" section, or managed in some other structured way to avoid duplicates (e.g., /events/... and /resources/videos/...)?

Context Kevin provided:

- Many webinars still remain in Events
- Migrating them as-is creates duplicates in the On-Demand section
- Some webinars already exist in both places with two different URLs
- Neither of us know who will own this process going forward (with Cody being gone)

**Mac McDonald** (4:04 PM):

> @Laura Giannola and I were just talking about needing a plan for this since they mostly live in Splash and need to be moved to Wistia.
>
> But yes we need to make a new webinar collection in videos. How we preserve the links is the tricky part. Idk what is currently being promoted or has ads pointing to them.
>
> We also need to kick off the Splash to .io project with Wooley once Regine has a few designs finished up.
>
> All of this should have a kick off meeting to discuss scope and next steps.

**Scott Weaver** (4:09 PM):

> @Mac Who would handle scheduling that kick-off meeting?
> (Probably gonna be a lot of questions like these in the wake of Cody leaving)

**Mac McDonald** (4:32 PM):

> Anyone can but I'd say Laura

**Laura Giannola** (4:50 PM):

> Thank you for the nomination 😊
>
> I'm going to try to sync with Funglin first to get the Demand Gen perspective on the webinars (gated/ungated) and then we can get into the tactical plans for moving them off Splash and where to have them live on .io.
>
> I'll add to our existing webinar/events doc so we can have all of these items and decisions in one spot.

## Key Points

- Webinars currently live in both Events and On-Demand sections (duplicate URLs)
- Need to migrate from Splash to Wistia
- Need to create new webinar collection in Videos section
- Link preservation is a concern (ads/promotions may point to existing URLs)
- Splash to .io project needs kick-off with Wooley once Regine finishes designs
- Laura will sync with Funglin for Demand Gen perspective on gated/ungated webinars
- Laura will add items to existing webinar/events doc

## Next Steps

- [ ] Laura to sync with Funglin on Demand Gen perspective
- [ ] Laura to update existing webinar/events doc
- [ ] Schedule kick-off meeting for Splash to .io project
- [ ] Determine ownership of webinar migration process (post-Cody)
