# Notes with Ian

## Discussion Summary for February 27th, 2025

We discussed Cloud sign-up tracking and conversion efficiency. I shared my Cloud.redis.io Notes and asked for more context on tracking the user journey from point A to B. Ian explained that our primary conversion page is redis.io/try-free/. His focus is on increasing conversion efficiency by analyzing the pages that drive traffic to that page.

## Key Points and Definitions

### Conversion Paths

- We talked about the various in-paths leading to the conversion page, including the "try" buttons and the University path, among others.
- The goal is to improve the efficiency of our conversion funnel.

### Tracking Systems

- I learned about the two main systems we use:
  - **Google Analytics (GA)**: Tracks web data (page visits, bounce rates, etc.).
  - **Service Manager (SM)**: Manages our cloud product data, tracking account creation, setup, and usage.
- We discussed that the SM ID (created by Service Manager) is not always directly linked to the GA ID generated by Google Analytics.
- Marketo Munchkins are mentioned as a tool used for tracking, though their exact role in facilitating the SM ID is still unclear.

### A/B Testing and Data Integration

- We agreed that a full-page A/B testing tool could be invaluable over the next 3-6 months. This tool should help:
  - Increase sign-ups.
  - Boost post-sign-up sales conversions.
- Ian highlighted the need for better integration between web tracking data and product usage data to understand the full customer journey. Although our conversion numbers have increased in absolute terms, the conversion rate percentage has declined.
- A key discussion point was ensuring a cohesive data handoff between our website and the product systems, involving both GA and SM data.

## Action Items and Next Steps

- I need to follow up on how the GA ID is passed to the Service Manager, and how Marketo Munchkins are involved in this process
