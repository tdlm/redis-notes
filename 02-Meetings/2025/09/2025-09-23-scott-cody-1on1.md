# Scott / Cody 1-on-1

**Date:** Tuesday, September 23, 2025

**Participants:**

- cody.henshaw@redis.com

## Valkey

- We changed from open source to source available, which triggered the fork
- AGPL / AWS won't use AGPL licensed products

## QPF on Pricing Calc

- Move "Add database" button up
- Add "QPF" column
  - QPF per database item
  - Disable Flex/Essentials when ANY QPF is set to something other than 1
  - Also add QPF column to Pro Breakdown
- Plus/minus buttons
  - Change them to icons that make sense
  - Maybe pin them to the bottom of the row
  - Less primary CTA-looking. Maybe make them grey.
- Pro Pricing Breakdown:
  - Make Pro Pricing breakdown wider so there's less scroll
  - Add "Total" heading to last item in table

## Other Topics

- Media Asset URLs
- Tutorials pages, next steps
- October time off
