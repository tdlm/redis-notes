# Scott / Cody 1-on-1

**Date:** Monday, September 8, 2025

**Participants:**

- cody.henshaw@redis.com

## Amplitude

- Nice to have: Add Amplitude tags around sizing calc components
- Amplitude will let us target/re-target people and let us connect to ad platforms
  - We might also have to enrich (through SalesForce) so we wouldn't reach out to all people who use the calculator
  - You can create a funnel to re-target non-conversions
  - We can also get interactions within Redis Insights
    - We can know if they're an ElastiCache user and checked out our pricing page

## Collisions RE: Careers URLs

- Pull all the live ones from WordPress and then map to all the ones that exist in Sanity

## Action Items

- Add redirects for all 97 Greenhouse jobs
