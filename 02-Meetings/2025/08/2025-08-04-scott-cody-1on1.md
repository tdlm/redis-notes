# Scott / Cody 1-on-1

**Date:** Monday, August 4, 2025

**Participants:**

- cody.henshaw@redis.com

## OKRs Discussion

Reference: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HPDEl822lgFAUxXsDf7712XEkcWpMA8mJlf_OeoXnvc/edit?tab=t.0

- We need to grow the business
  - Self serve and through sales
- Pain points:
  - Good at acquisition; Bad at getting people to stick around
    - We're expensive (compared to competitors)
    - We have a lot of outages
- We can own acquisition. Put more people in the funnel and capture more of them.
- It's not really a funnel

## My OKRs

- Grow the cloud, help sales win, focusing on optimizing the funnel to hand-raisers, or optimize the funnel to sign up for cloud

## Expansion

- RE: Sid — one of the problems with Redis Cloud and Enterprise is RE: Pro — the only differentiation between that and signing a contract deal is that we can save you money and offer support.
