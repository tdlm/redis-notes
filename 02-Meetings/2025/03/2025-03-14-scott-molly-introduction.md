# Scott / Molly Introduction

## Action Items

- Molly will send me a login to Mutiny

## Notes

Molly Leon

Molly, when she first came to Redis, supported ABM with AEs with 14 different accounts. SA. Were seeing some success and then were some ready for ABM. Wasn't the best selection. VP of sales was like: these are the accounts you want to go after, only if it makes sense. Previous boss, Allie, ended up leaving 1.5 mos ago. With that switch, we re-evaluated what ABM meant to Redis. It was a team of 3, and now it's 2. Gaby moved back to 1:1 field marketing on the ABM side. Just supporting one of our RSDs and Mollie has shifted away from 1:1 and shifted from 1:few. Mutiny is a tool we used when we were 1:1. Started in July --- 9 months ago. Focus is now on 1:few on the digital side. Mutiny, personalization on inbound/outbound, paid ads. Historically, our industries were gaming, finance, healthcare and retail. Main four pillars. Product Marketing team has done some analysis on industries bringing in the highest ARR.

ABM = Account Based Marketing
AE = Account Executives
OTM = One To Many

Focus will be mostly on Financial Services and TELCOM. Partnering more with product sales on messaging and really creating the personalized experience likely for the top 200 accounts in those sectors. Where I view our alignment, is that we'll be doing a lot of A/B testing. Just renewed with Mutiny (you can do testing there). Whatever tool we'll be going with will likely be the free version.

What we'd talked about is making sure we'd be aligned on any testing you're doing; making sure it doesn't interfere with any personalization I'm doing on my side. Molly will be the main operator of Mutiny; people can do things, but Molly has to approve. There's an OOP of what takes priority with audience overlap, etc. What we're doing outside of Mutiny should not impact our testing and vice versa.

We just resigned Mutiny right before I went out on my honeymoon; just got back. The previous owner of Mutiny had done a bunch of stuff -- very messy. Cleaning it up and archiving things that didn't make sense. Coming up with new naming conventions.

Cody is running a current homepage banner test -- set up two weeks ago. Not sure what goal is with that. Molly will get me in there.

Eventually, we'll have an Asana form for account people to fill in. Molly will never be the owner of the actual setup. It's more launching/executing. Before you launch, you can prioritize where your experiment where you want to live.

Moving forward, once I'm grounded in my role, and I'm working on different experiments and platforms that we go forward with, we'll have some regular cadence/check-in to make sure we're always aligned. We might end up creating some sort of document so in between the touch points so we can keep track of overlap.
