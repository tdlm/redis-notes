# Web Standup - AI Discussion

## Topic

- AI

## GPT Summary

We recognized that our briefs often lack clear intent, leading to mixed approaches across our AI and Redis marketing pages. We discussed the need to consolidate existing content, update copy where necessary, and establish clear CTAs to drive engagement—whether through a demo, vector search, or a simplified user journey. We agreed that by streamlining our content and focusing on a unified goal, we can better guide users through our offerings and improve conversion while keeping our pages both user-friendly and SEO optimized.

## AI Discussion

Haskew: Not understanding the intent or goal in briefs in Asana.
Jim: Making three marketing pages on AI.
Cody: Talked about stitching existing content together. Caching should have an AI bent. Those are the main ones.
Haskew: Copy updates and not design?
Cody: Yes.
Haskew: AI Learn page is too long; we can just update the copy. Trying to determine what success looks like for some of these pages before I pass on to Mac.
Keith M: Try it yourself goes to docs. My challenge there is that it gets at the core of: this is not a problem you can solve, JAWs (Jim Allen Wallace). AI is something you can do with Redis but not necessarily Redis as a product. It's a weird call to action. It might be the most appropriate one.
Jim: As an idea, how do you jump in with less friction? Like, the Playground, do a vector search. We could do a demo video. We want the devs to get hands on. We did a collab notebook but that's not a great option.
Cody: Lancache? sign-up page. There's a lack of a conversion event at all on this page. We put the Redis for AI button on the top right nav.
Haskew: Redis for AI / Google Doc in Asana. Any conversation about data is not making it to Haskew / Mac on the brief.
Keith M: Drop a URL in the chat when we're working on an existing page.
Mac: When I'm working on pages like this, am I building it to my most ideal design state or am I building it in the boat it's already in so we can get it out quick?
JAWs: I'd like to work on modules.
Keith M: On the AI topic, I feel like we're five feet off the ground. What I'd love to see is: every page on the site related to Redis AI (redis.io/learn/vector); take them and say what's the end goal? What are we wanting them to do? Do they need to visit all of those pages for this to make sense? Is there a specific CTA, like if we're driving someone to the vector page, what are we wanting them to do? Part of it is piecing it together. AI here means a lot of things (Vector, Semantic Caching, etc.). I don't know if these things are even related or are they as useful as a Swiss Army Knife in an emergency situation?
JAWs: My main goal is that people get into the product and use a vector database for the first time.
Keith M: Is that the goal on vector or Redis AI?
JAWs: Both. If we can get people to learn about the product, use it, then they have to go and take it to the next steps. If we can root them to that.
Keith M: Do you mind putting that into a really quick deck for me? That would be helpful. In that world, it kind of feels like we're calling the same thing multiple names to some degree. If the goal of Redis for AI is to get them to use Vector, I think we might want to try and collectively clean that up a little bit. There's a better experience we can come up with.
JAWs: We can do fewer things, depending on which funnel they come in through. We need a path for that journey.
Keith M: That's a great point. On the Vector page, it almost feels like a comparison page (you're comparing us vs the world of vector options) and that's different from the AI page. Ideally you hit the try button. The AI page is a combination of all of the things that you could use. Except for very clear journeys and SEO, I'm always a fan of fewer URLs on the website. The website is turning into the stadium after the game. I have a hard time navigating it. The more we can say: here are the three things on this page, we will crush. We'll be able to change them faster and measure their success. I'm struggling with entry points. What's the best way to simplify this Redis for AI Story? The easiest way would be an actual SKU (?). For the brand team and anyone working on the copy on these pages (like Redis for AI pages), I'd make it dead simple. That benchmarking graph; that seems dead simple. Personalized AI responses with long-term memory. I don't think I've got that one.
Claudia: That aligns. We did a whole audit of the website. For this page, what is the CTA? For me, there are three: Learn Funnel, Do Something (download funnel) and SEO. From those three--
Keith M: Learn, Experience, --
Claudia: I still think that exercise is the right one to keep in mind as we go through pages. When we land on these pages (like the AI page), what is that CTA and keep that as the ultimate goal in mind so we can keep things as short and simple as possible.
Haskew: That allowed us to take into account every other page that talked about a page. It's not always about creating a new page; sometimes it's about repackaging existing content. Do we need to throw a new page on the website? It's falling on me and Mac to ask that question where it should be asked way earlier in the process.
Keith M: I think we're all in violent agreement.
Cody: Yes.
Keith M: so let's just pull it up a little bit. If it were up to me, we'd have a one page no nav site. We can't do that for SEO purposes. Cody would want Berkshire Hathaway. If we could pull off the one page that's so compelling; that's the dream from a conversion standpoint.
Cody: One quick point -- the average user on a site visits 1.6 pages; if we're going to think about the user journey, let's make it about that. It's going to require some consolidation.
Keith M: Pages for robots -- F those robots. Those pages suck by design. As our content gets consumed by AI. The pages for humans are better.
Adrian: We can link to parts of pages.
Keith M: There's all sorts of options. We have to be careful real estate wise. This Redis for AI story; it's a handful of products or data types and painting that picture, I think we have the people on this call to do that in a very sophisticated way, if we started with that as the goal. My gut tells me we're not; we're just shipping things into the world. Should we treat every page as a funnel? JAWs, the vector compare makes sense to 100% of the world. That mechanic exists on your average deodorant site. I want to learn whether this thing is applicable for my needs and I want to try it as fast as humanly possible. We don't have an engineering team that has a very deep user empathy ethos. PMs have to play that role.
