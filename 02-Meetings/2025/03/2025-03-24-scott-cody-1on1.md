# Scott / Cody 1:1

## Talking Points

- Pricing Calculator Launch - Today
  - Got it on Test
- A/B Testing - Statsig / PostHog
  - Looking at the Statsig integration
- Pricing Calculator on new platform priority?

We should scope out what the A/B testing tool PoC is going to take to stand something up. We'll need to get the pricing calc on the new platform ideally before end of April.

RE: A/B Testing Demo Center (example) → 50% of logged out users might see a gate
Hypothesis: We'd get more high quality leads having a gate. The trade-off would be X number of visitors to the page.
Today, you have to watch one of these and then go to a separate page to book a meeting. Reaching this page doesn't mean a user is a lead!

Video player is Wistia. We could potentially show the call form when you pause or the video ends.

Qualifying form would collect a subset of the Personalized Demo form and then pre-fill those values in the form.

Different sign-up flows could be path chains.

We'll still have Mutiny on the Sanity site. We've run into problems with conflicts.

Want to have the fastest site on the Internet.

SKO global speed index that we want to create. Build a tool that will give you a speed index. It's really a lead capture and marketing tool.

StatSig is inexpensive. We'll run these things and hopefully they're not

When we're ready for kicking off a PoC.

We probably don't need the full Statsig installed from the Marketplace.
