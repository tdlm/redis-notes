# Chat with Mac RE: Design System

## Topics

- Top is sometimes nav and sometimes eyebrow
- Pricing calculator doesn't have sub nav items, so it's an eyebrow
- Resource Center vs Dev Hub
  - Resource Center = blog
  - Dev Hub = redis university, tutorials, videos, webinars, etc.
- In those cases, the same style heading we have on pricing calc is an Eyebrow
- Under Company, it will serve as a Subnav
- Eyebrow vs. Subnav — could have similar styles
- We don't know where we are in a site
- Breadcrumbs will tell us how deep we are into a given space
  - Mostly only going to be in the Dev Hub or the Resource Center
  - Do we have a current hierarchy?
- Mac is doing brainstorming on dev/resource hub categorization:

- Mac started August of last year under Xander who was willy-nilly designing things
- Mac has made a lot of progress to establish standards

- We're redoing the homepage!
- Will we support dark and light mode for all our components?
