# Web Standup

## Topic

- Spring Release

## Discussion

### Spring Release

- Any items open on that? Seems like bugs are mostly ironed out?
- Mac: AFAIK everything's been addressed. There's a chat but Scott A is on it.

### Pricing Calculator

- Looks good for announcement
- Still have small nitpicks which we'll address
- And we'll keep evolving it and seeing if it's even useful
