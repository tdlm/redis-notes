# Sanity & Redis Customer Kick-off Call

Andrew Hoffman
Aaron Emery - Solutions Architect, based in Seattle
Sam
Cody
Scott W
William Johnston
Off call:

- Nancy Du (Sr Solution Architect)
- Daniel Favand (Solution Architecture Manager / Canada)
- Patrick Wallace (VP of something)
- And a bunch of others

## Summary

Aaron from Sanity will support by reviewing architecture, assessing the project's current state, and identifying areas to add value. Day-to-day communication will happen in the Slack channel (#s-redis-sla), where questions are acknowledged with a ticket icon; responses follow SLA. Additional support is available via email and phone. Sanity offers developer certification and self-paced courses at sanity.io/learn/profile. We have five onboarding hours included, which can be used for content modeling, architecture sessions, and end-user training post-launch. Monthly check-ins led by Aaron will provide implementation guidance and product feedback. A Miro onboarding whiteboard was shared (password: redis-sanity). The target go-live is May, likely as a rolling launch to avoid 404s. Miro sessions tied to Sanity's Spring Release (Infra as Code) will be postponed until onboarding progresses. Lastly, Redis is used in their Sanity stack.
