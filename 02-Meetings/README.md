# Meeting Notes

This directory contains **ALL meeting notes** - business meetings, personal meetings, discussions, coaching sessions, and any other dated notes from meetings or conversations.

## Critical Rule

**ALL meeting notes go here**, regardless of topic:
- Business meetings → `02-Meetings/` (NOT `08-Business/`)
- Personal meetings → `02-Meetings/` (NOT `09-Personal/`)
- People-related meetings → `02-Meetings/` (NOT `05-People/`)
- Coaching sessions → `02-Meetings/`
- Discussions and syncs → `02-Meetings/`

## Naming Convention

**Format:** `[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[title].md`

**Examples:**
- `2025-11-10-business-partner-meeting.md`
- `2025-09-26-client-discussion.md`
- `2025-12-15-personal-coaching-session.md`

**Rules:**
- Date format: YYYY-MM-DD (ISO 8601)
- Date comes first for chronological sorting
- Title should be lowercase with hyphens separating words
- Title should be descriptive but concise
- No spaces in filenames (use hyphens instead)

## Folder Structure

Meeting notes are organized by year and month:

```
02-Meetings/
├── [YYYY]/
│   └── [MM]/
│       └── [YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]-[title].md
└── templates/
    └── meeting-template.md
```

**Example:**
```
02-Meetings/
├── 2025/
│   ├── 01/
│   │   └── 2025-01-15-team-sync.md
│   └── 11/
│       └── 2025-11-10-business-partner-meeting.md
└── templates/
    └── meeting-template.md
```

## Using the Template
