### Implement Generic RC Plan Detection and R Parameter Passing

- **Status:** Done

- **Link:**

- **Summary:**

  Add detection for RC plan parameter and pass through as "r" parameter. SMUI codebase looks for RC plan under parameter called "r" (not "RC plan"). Generic solution: take any RC plan value and set r equal to that value. Will work for all RC plans, not just LaneCash-specific.

- **Notes:**

  - From: 2025-11-05 Seth/Scott - RC Plan Parameter
  - Implementation scope: Google and GitHub SSO options
  - Code architecture concern: LaneCash-specific code embedded in generic signup functionality
  - SMUI has 6-7 different RC plans with some having special handling
