Team,

I want to share that Keith Messick, our Chief Marketing Officer, will be leaving Redis later this month.

Keith joined Redis at a pivotal moment and quickly got to work transforming our marketing function. Under his leadership, we reenergized our brand, sharpened our story, built a scalable demand engine, and strengthened our connection to developers through a more technical marketing motion. The team he built, with its culture of ownership and creative hustle, will continue to serve Redis well for years to come.

We've begun the search for our next head of marketing, who will report directly to me. In the meantime, please join me in thanking Keith for his many contributions. We'll miss his insight, his perspective, and his sense of humor, and we wish him all the best in whatever comes next.

Warmly,  
Rowan
