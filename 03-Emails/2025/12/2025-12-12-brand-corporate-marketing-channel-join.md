## Partner Network LP Timeline

**Adam Haskew** - 10:49 AM (reply to thread)

> hey, @allison and @claudia.di-martino! just chatted with Mac re: the partner program lp.
>
> based on our convo, we are going to start with Fionce's brief and supplement copy based on the latest developments with the program (level names, etc).
>
> keeping in mind that Mac and i are both out 12/22-1/2, here's a timeline for next steps including stakeholder reviews:
>
> - **12/15-16**: Adam delivers drafted content for LP; Mac starts on initial wireframes for page layout with existing components
> - **12/17-19**: Brand team reviews Gdoc for any missing content/necessary functionality; wireframes complete and place copy in figma
> - **EOD 12/19**: Share figma for async stakeholder review
> - **12/22-1/2**: Stakeholder reviews; based on cals/planned PTO this should give them plenty of time to review
>
> this timeline combines content and design a bit to keep things on track according to the existing schedule without cutting into dev time.

## NASDAQ Photo Edit Request

**Corey Lewis** - 2:32 PM (reply to thread)

> One more question: I want to include some of the pictures too, or maybe use it for a future post, and the Gen Z slang one is most complete, but they got the final picture while the letters were still scrolling so it says "Gen Z slanh." Is there someone who can tweak this photo in Photoshop or whatever to have it spelled correctly? And possibly add a question mark at the end...
