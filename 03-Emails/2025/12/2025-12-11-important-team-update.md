# Important team update

**From:** Megan Boone <megan.boone@redis.com>  
**To:** Marketing Department <marketing.group@redis.com>  
**Date:** Thursday, December 11, 2025 at 7:54 PM

Cody is no longer with Redis. This was a difficult but necessary decision to set this entire team up for success.

Product & Technical Marketing is a strategically critical function for Redis. It sits at the center of how we position our products, influence the market, enable sales, and tell a unified story. The bar must be extremely high because the impact of getting it right is enormous. This change is about meeting that bar.

## Here's what you need to know:

### Structure

- Product Marketing and Technical Marketing remain one integrated team.
- Growth Marketing will operate as a standalone function under a new leader.
- Web will move to brand for now, with the intention to move back to growth long-term. We will be hiring a web manager ASAP.

### Interim support

An experienced product marketing consultant will join us immediately to provide support for SKO, which remains our top priority.

### Hiring

I am actively interviewing VP Product Marketing candidates and will move quickly.

### Priorities

Current deliverables and deadlines remain unchanged.

We're building a world-class Product & Technical Marketing function, and this step moves us in that direction.

If you have questions or concerns, come directly to me.
