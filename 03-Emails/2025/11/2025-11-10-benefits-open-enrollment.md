Dear All,

Open Enrollment begins today and runs through Friday, November 21st. This is the time when you can enroll, waive, or change benefit plans for the upcoming 2026 plan year.

All changes you make in ADP will be effective January 1, 2026. After Open Enrollment ends, you will be locked into any benefits you elect for the year, unless you have a qualifying life event. So please review your changes carefully.

It is a Passive enrollment this year -- meaning your current 2025 benefit elections will automatically carry over except for FSA and HSA elections. We highly encourage you to login to ADP to review/update beneficiaries, confirm your personal and dependent information is accurate, and/or make any changes to your benefit elections for the 2026 plan year.

## WHAT'S NEW FOR 2026?

Redis is pleased to announce that employee cost shares will remain flat for 2026. Despite industry-wide healthcare cost increases, Redis has chosen to fully absorb the additional expense to ensure employees do not experience any increase in their premiums.

In 2026, your dental benefits will be provided through Cigna. The plan will mirror your current Delta Dental coverage, so you will enjoy the same great benefits with a wider network of providers!

Redis is also transitioning our Health Savings Account (HSA), Flexible Spending Account (FSA), and Commuter Benefits from Optum to Navia – a move designed to offer a more user-friendly experience and streamlined support. More instructions on how to transfer your existing Optum HSA funds to Navia will be shared in December.

In 2026, we're moving Life & Disability and our voluntary benefits (Accident, Critical Illness, Hospital Indemnity) to Unum.

VSP Members now have an increased frame allowance of $180. This includes access to VSP Lightcare, which provides a $180 allowance for ready-made non-prescription sunglasses or non-prescription blue light filtering glasses, in lieu of prescription glasses or contacts.

The IRS has released the 2026 contribution limits, giving you more ways to save:

- HSA Individual: $4,400
- HSA Family: $8,750
- Health FSA: $3,400
- Dependent Care FSA: $5,000
- Commuter: $340

We are excited about these changes and confident they'll bring added value and convenience to your benefits experience!
