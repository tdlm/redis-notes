Hey :redis: edis team :wave::skin-tone-5:! Here's what we've been up to so far this week:

---

## :star2: FEATURES :star2:

### :last_quarter_moon: Dark Mode Planning :last_quarter_moon:

We've turned part of our focus to the dark-Mode pre planning.

- We've worked on a new component for reuse in different sections to allow Light mode and Dark mode mage uploads.
- @mac - essentially what we discussed for News logos but reusable for other sections.

### :robot_face: Sanity Dataset :robot_face:

We've started setting up a staging dataset in Sanity. This includes leveraging the Sanity Backup tool Sam built to handle the export and import of production data.

### :film_projector: Webinars :film_projector:

- The pages for webinars were delivered, we've been working on updating styles and logic.
- Following feedback from @mac we'll continue refining.
- If we could confirm the 2 points raised with @Laura Giannola that would be ace.
- We'll action the designs for multi-date once received from Mac.

### :computer: :book: In-Browser Resources :book: :computer:

- We've continued refining the new in-browser resource experience.
- We'll be working on feedback from Mac in Pastel

### :books: Resource Center: :books:

- We're continuing to roll out updates to this based off feedback.
- When the current rounds are finished we can continue the rollout of remaining Resource Center updates.

## Follow-up Discussion

**Mac McDonald**

@Bonny sorry for the delay here. Getting myself sorted after being out last week.

**Notes/questions:**

**Events & Webinars -**

- Upcoming Webinars → appear on the Events page, styled like standard Event pages.
  - This makes sense, the CTA button currently says "Watch now" but I assume that would be more like "Sign up" since it's not live/on-demand yet. Right?
- We still need a multi-date drop down option for events/webinars. For example, we have the same event/webinar happening across different time zones. We want users to be able see and register for time/date that works for them vs. having multiple cards of the same event for each time zone. I owe you a design for that.
