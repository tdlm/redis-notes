Dear Redis Team,

We want to share our year-to-date results for the FY26 bonus plan. The plan measures performance on a year-to-date basis against the FY26 ending ARR incentive target of $336.6M and full-year non-GAAP operating margin of -8.0%.

## YTD Bonus Attainment Results

For the year-to-date ending Q3, our attainment percentages are as follows:

- **ARR (80% weighting)** - 68% attainment
- **Operating margin (20% weighting)** - 90% attainment
- **Blended YTD attainment** - 72%

Our bonus plan pays out based on year-to-date (YTD) company performance, which means each quarter's payment is adjusted ("trued up") so the total payout stays aligned with our YTD results.

## What This Means for Q3 Payouts

- **Q1:** We were at 100% YTD, so bonuses were paid at 100% of target.
- **Q2:** YTD performance dropped to 80%, so both Q1 and Q2 were trued up to that level. Most people received 60% of their Q2 target after applying that true-up.
- **Q3:** YTD performance is now 72%, down from 80% last quarter. As a result, most Q3 payouts will be 56%* of the quarterly target.

*Actual payout % may vary based on start date or mid-year bonus target changes.

## Timing of Q3 Payouts

- **US, Israel, UK, India, Singapore, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, and Canada:** paid in November payroll
- **All other locations:** paid in December payroll

If you have any questions, please review the FY26 Employee Bonus Plan or reach out to me directly.

Thank you,  
Zoë
