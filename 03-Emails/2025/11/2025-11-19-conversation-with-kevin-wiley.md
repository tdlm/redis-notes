# Conversation with Kevin Wiley

## Kevin Wiley
**7:18 PM**

Hey Scott, is it possible for you or WM to edit the "Title" field for the "Hero" sections so that we can add HTML like `<br>` and have it break the line? For example, on the Korean homepage, they want the text marked in "red" on the second line. I have a space in between but it puts part of the text on line 1 and the second part on line 2 but "빨라집니다" is one word and should all be on the same line.

Hey Kevin, could that maybe be a subtitle we add?

## Kevin Wiley
**8:36 AM**

Yes, I can try that. Can you add a subtitle field?

## Scott Weaver
**8:39 AM**

Do you have a Figma for this at all for that red or anything?

## Kevin Wiley
**8:42 AM**

No, all of these language pages are being translated but without a Figma.
