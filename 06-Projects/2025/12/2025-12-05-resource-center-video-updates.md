## Description

Video resources doc here – This is a list compiled from what we currently have on the "on-demand" webinars section of the events and webinars page, plus a list Avery put together in Wistia. I've added a lot of them myself to test things, but they need to be double-checked.

Since these are hosted on Splash and we're sunsetting that tool, I'm not sure what the transition plan is. We won't be using these landing pages anymore but I'm hesitant to change anything in case there are campaigns or ads…

### Kevin Willey (6 days ago, edited)

Accidentally posted questions early; made edits above. About 40 of these—will wait until Laura returns next week…

### Laura Giannotta (Today at 6:17am)

Chatted with Mac about this.  
TL;DR: We need to move these off Splash and onto redis.io.  
Need DG team validation on whether all webinars move over.
